# fsolauncher-next
A 2021 launcher made with Electron. 
Made to eventually replace [the current launcher](https://github.com/ItsSim/fsolauncher-legacy) which is being used in open beta on Windows and macOS.

## Goals
* A more intuitive, less clicky launcher.
* Widget system with plenty of game stats.
* Windows and macOS support.
* A fresh new look ready for 2021.
* Full rewrite! The current launcher has been pretty much the same since 2016.
* CLI mode.

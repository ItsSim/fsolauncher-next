# fsolauncher-next
A 2020 launcher made with Electron. Made to eventually replace the [current fsolauncher](https://github.com/ItsSim/fsolauncher) which is being used in open beta on Windows and macOS.

## Goals
* A more intuitive, less clicky launcher.
* A fresh new look ready for 2020.
* Full rewrite! The current launcher has been pretty much the same since 2016.
* Windows and macOS support.

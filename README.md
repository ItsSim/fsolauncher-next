# fsolauncher-next
A 2019 launcher made with Electron. Made to eventually replace the [current fsolauncher](https://github.com/ItsSim/fsolauncher) which is being used in open beta only on Windows.

## Goals
* A more intuitive, less clicky launcher.
* A fresh new look ready for 2019/2020.
* Full rewrite! The current launcher has been pretty much the same since 2016.
* Linux and MacOS support.

## Early Previews

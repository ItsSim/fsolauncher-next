# fsolauncher-next
A next-gen FreeSO Launcher.

## Goals
* <strong>More than x10 smaller, lower memory usage, and improved startup times.</strong>
   - <strong>How:</strong> By ditching Electron and using a desktop application framework that does not bundle Chromium.
   
* <strong>A more intuitive, less clicky launcher.</strong>
   - <strong>How:</strong> The launcher now uses a modern JavaScript framework that makes it easier to build intuitive experiences. The process of installing and running FreeSO has been thoroughly improved.
   
* <strong>An all new Widget system to keep up with what happens in Sunrise Crater.</strong>
   - <strong>How:</strong> The launcher now consumes FreeSO’s APIs in order to offer you the latest information about what’s going on in-game.
   
* <strong>Windows, macOS (Intel/M1) and linux support.</strong>
   - <strong>How:</strong> The previous launcher already achieved macOS support. This version is taking it a step further to support linux-based operating systems as well.
   
* <strong>A fresh new look.</strong>
   - <strong>How:</strong> The whole interface is being revamped, using space more efficiently and improving the user experience.
   
* <strong>Full rewrite! The current launcher has been pretty much the same since 2016.</strong>
   - <strong>How:</strong> By following popular JavaScript conventions with modern frameworks. This makes the launcher overall better and makes it easier for people to contribute to its development over time.
   
* <strong>Hybrid features (CLI/GUI mode).</strong>
   - <strong>How:</strong> The launcher now supports CLI and GUI modes. This means that if you prefer to use the launcher as a command line application, you will be able to.

## Transition plans
The launcher would be made available to current users through a regular update. New users would be able to download it from https://beta.freeso.org as usual.
